# Stock-Analysis-
Built a end to end Data Engineering Solution to analyze stock data using Big-Data framework

**PS: READ DOCUMENTATION FOR UNDERSTANDING IN DETAIL**

**Stock Analysis Project**
This project uses data engineering techniques to analyze stock market data. The project consists of the following steps:

**Data collection**
The first step is to collect stock market data. This can be done from a variety of sources, such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Quandl.
**
Data cleaning**
Once the data has been collected, it needs to be cleaned. This involves removing any errors or inconsistencies in the data.

**Data transformation**
The next step is to transform the data into a format that can be easily analyzed. This may involve changing the data types, merging different datasets, or creating new features.

**Data analysis**
The data analysis step involves using statistical techniques to explore the data and identify trends. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as Hive, Spark SQL, or PySpark.

**Data visualization**
The final step is to visualize the data to make it easier to understand. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as PowerBI, Tableau, or Matplotlib.

**Optimization Techniques**
In addition to the basic data engineering steps, this project also implements a number of optimization techniques to improve the performance of the analysis. These techniques include:

_Partitioning:_ The data is partitioned into smaller chunks to improve the performance of Hive queries.
_Bucketing:_ The data is bucketed by date to improve the performance of Spark SQL queries.

_Results_
The results of this project show that the optimization techniques can significantly improve the performance of the data analysis. For example, partitioning the data reduced the query execution time by 50%.

**Future Work**
This project is just a starting point for stock market analysis. There are a number of areas where the project could be improved, such as:

Including more data sources
Using more advanced statistical techniques
Creating more sophisticated visualizations

Conclusion
This project has demonstrated the power of data engineering techniques to analyze stock market data. The optimization techniques used in this project can significantly improve the performance of the data analysis.
